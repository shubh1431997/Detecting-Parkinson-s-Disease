# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease-ML
What is Parkinson’s Disease?                                           
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. 
It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. 
This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

Detecting Parkinson’s Disease – Objective
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

Detecting Parkinson’s Disease – About the Python Machine Learning Project
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and ml algorithm , we will build a model using various algorithm. 
We’ll load the data, get the features and checking for null values,datatypes , removing unwanted columns, then split the dataset, build model, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.
